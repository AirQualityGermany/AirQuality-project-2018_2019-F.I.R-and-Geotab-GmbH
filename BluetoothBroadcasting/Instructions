# Bluetooth Payload

The bluetooth payload transmits the sensor Informations. 
The geotab sdk describes it here: https://geotab.github.io/sdk/hardware/addon-protocols/ble/
Compatible bluetooth beacons are for example the BeWhere Beacons. They are able to transmit their sensor data (temperature, light, accelerometer) to the go7 devices.
